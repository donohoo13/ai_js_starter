# self-reports gaps. It informs, never blocks: always exits 0.

# Node pin drift. npm enforces package.json devEngines against the running
# Node for any npx/npm invocation with this project as cwd and treats onFail
# "download" as an error, so a shell whose ambient Node differs from the pin
# loses every npx-launched tool here — including Claude Code plugin MCP
# servers, which fail with an opaque -32000. pnpm-routed commands are immune
# (pnpm downloads the pinned runtime); this warning exists to name the cause.
# The probe has two paths. Under a package-manager lifecycle (pnpm "prepare"
# sets npm_config_user_agent and puts the provisioned pinned runtime first on
# PATH) bare `node` can only ever see the pin, so the developer's shell is
# asked instead — interactive rc first, because version managers commonly
# init there, and the login shell only as fallback (measured here: the login
# PATH resolved a different, non-manager Node than interactive shells see).
# Both probes are non-fatal by design: a broken shim (asdf/mise with no
# version selected) degrades to no drift warning, never a dead script, so
# the LSP checks below always still run and the exit-0 contract holds.
