// Preinstall guard: hard-fail an install not run through pnpm, and any install
// running on the wrong Node version. Dependency-free on purpose — this runs
// before node_modules exists, so built-ins only. Every failure path prints an
// actionable message and exits 1; a raw stack trace from here is a bug in here.
//
// pnpm-only, because the workspace protocol, the runtime pin, and the lockfile
// all assume pnpm; a stray `npm install` half-installs and corrupts the lockfile
// story. Read from the installer's own user agent, so it needs no dependencies.
//
// ── The Node pin: four sites, one version ───────────────────────────────────
//   .nvmrc                      exact version. The source of truth, and what nvm reads.
//   engines.node                ">=<version> <<major+1>". The range this file enforces.
//   devEngines.runtime.version  exact version. What pnpm downloads and runs scripts under.
//   pnpm-lock.yaml              regenerate and commit; stale fails --frozen-lockfile, CI's default.
// This file cross-checks the first three on every install BEFORE it checks the
// machine, because a partial retarget is otherwise indistinguishable from a
// broken environment and sends the reader hunting through their Node installs
// for a repo bug.
//
// ── Why these defaults, so a project can diverge deliberately ───────────────
// Each choice below was measured, not assumed; the versions, probes, and
// observations live in the CHANGELOG. Change one only with equivalent evidence.
//
// devEngines.runtime, NOT pnpm-workspace.yaml's useNodeVersion.
//   useNodeVersion worked correctly through pnpm 10 and was REMOVED in pnpm 11,
//   which ignores the leftover key silently: no warning, and `pnpm config get
//   use-node-version` still echoes the value back. So a pnpm major bump used to
//   disarm the pin with no visible signal. The general claim "useNodeVersion
//   does not work" is false and misleads the next debugger — it is specifically
//   gone in 11. Never assume a runtime setting engaged because it reads back.
//
// engineStrict OFF wherever devEngines is present — on pnpm <=10.
//   pnpm's own settings docs recommend pairing engineStrict with nodeVersion,
//   so a project that followed them carries it. On pnpm <=10, alongside
//   devEngines the pair deadlocks: the engines check runs against the AMBIENT
//   Node before pnpm switches to the pinned runtime, so every pnpm command
//   fails on any other Node — including the install that would have downloaded
//   it. pnpm 11+ provisions the runtime BEFORE that check, so the pairing
//   installs cleanly and the two coexist (measured). The guard below hard-fails
//   the pairing only on pnpm <=10; read it for the measurement and the fix.
//
// An exact version, NEVER a range.
//   On pnpm <=10 a range abandoned runtime resolution entirely and installed a
//   third-party `node` package from the registry (bin creation ENOENT, blocked
//   setup script, lifecycle scripts on the AMBIENT Node). On pnpm 11 the range
//   resolves a real runtime, but the node runtime's own build script trips the
//   build allowlist (ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS), so `pnpm exec` then fails at
//   startup — measured. Either way a range breaks the pin, so it stays exact.
//   The exact spelling also earns the lockfile per-platform nodejs.org URLs with
//   integrity hashes; a range records none.
//
// Accepted cost: npm reads devEngines before preinstall and treats onFail
//   "download" as "error", so `npm install` on any other Node dies with
//   EBADDEVENGINES rather than reaching the pnpm-only message below. The install
//   still stops, which is this guard's actual job; only the diagnosis degrades.
//   The change that would fix it (a range) breaks the pin outright, per above.
//
// Known limit — musl: nodejs.org publishes no musl build, so on Alpine pnpm
//   resolves the glibc tarball and the install dies at exec time with a "not
//   found" naming a binary that plainly exists. musl projects DELETE the
//   devEngines block and keep .nvmrc plus engines.node as the contract; this
//   guard treats an absent block as that deliberate posture, not as drift.
//
// This guard is not decorative: devEngines engages only when the pnpm running
// the install honors it. pnpm 9 (which also defaults manage-package-manager-
// versions to false, so it ignores the packageManager pin), a non-pnpm
// installer, or a sandbox with no network all land here on the ambient Node.
